      <h1>What is Git?</h1>
      <p>Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work.</p>

        <h2>Why Do Developers Need Git?</h2>
            <p>Developers need Git because it helps them manage project files, track changes, and collaborate with other team members. Git allows developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously through branches, which can later be merged into the main project.</p>

      <h2>What is a Branch in Git?</h2>
            <p>A branch in Git is an independent line of development. By creating branches, developers can work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main project. Once the work is complete, the branch can be merged back into the main branch.</p>
